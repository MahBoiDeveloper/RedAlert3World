this map is my first and is not a good looking one there are no trees roads or any of that fancy junk
but there is a very challenging place for people who like to play offense
the defenders have ironclad frontal defenses but north of player 2 position
is a pass that is only covered by light defenses and also in that area are mcv's from each faction
each player has 3 ore nodes and a ton of oil derricks at their disposal
power is not a problem for either player. as the defrender you have bunkers
and in front are units that go in the bunkers. 
for the offense i have provided 2 allied war factories and 2 allied barracks . take the hint.
and there are a line or sentry guns in case the opponebnst tries to attack with the bunker infantry
thanks for downloading plese send feed backand enjoy commander!
