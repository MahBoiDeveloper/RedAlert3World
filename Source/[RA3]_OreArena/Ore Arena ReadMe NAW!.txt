Woah, never thought I would be writing this...
After I don't know how many days.
This is done.

My only wishes is that this wipes that damn War Arena off the face of this community. That may be violent speaking,
a bit harsh, but me and Mando don't like each other. Many people have told me how horrible War Arena is, it's
because Mando barely spent even half a second thinking about balance, but, I did. I spent hours upon hours PERFECTING
this map, I can assure you this map is near perfect. Of course I'm going to make latter versions, of course I'm going
to do bug checks, but this version is really good, better then you'll see most maps like this in v1.0.

So, have fun, spread this map, that's the important part, SPREAD THIS MAP. So much work, I want people to PLAY it.


If you have any suggestions or bug/exploit reports, please PM me on the Command and Conquer website
(www.commandandconquer.com)(my name is EvilConker) or send them to squidly2000@yahoo.com.

Ok, have fun, and SPREAD THIS MAP.

Also, keep checking for newer versions on the original Ore Arena topic at the Official Command And Conquer Forums.

VERSION 1.2 NOTE:

I lost my first game on 1.2, bad omen?
