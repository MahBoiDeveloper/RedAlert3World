Please, do not edit this map and credit it as yours. I've spent a ton of time on this and I hope you understand, thanks.
If you want to change something, feel free to contact me and I will consider it. 


Players spawn units in their bases by moving around engineers. 4 players battle in the War Arena for kills
and War Points. They can be used to buy better units and support powers. For the complete playing instruction,
follow the tutorial boxes in game.

When doing 2v2 you should use the non-FFA version of the map and the people on the same team should take the
top 2 spots or the bottom 2 spots. Aka top vs. bottom.



Installation Instructions:
show hidden folders (go to 'tools>folder options>view')

extract the folders to the following location:
Windows XP:
C:\Documents and Settings\<name>\Application Data\Red Alert 3\Maps\

Windows Vista:
C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Roaming\Red Alert 3\Maps\
