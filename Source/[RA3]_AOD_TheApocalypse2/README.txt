DESCRIPTION   |X|

This is an Art of Defense styled map. It lasts for 30 minutes and whilst
that timer is progressing, you will have to defend yourself against the
incomming brutal attack waves from Krukov, the traitor that commanded
you to attack the Premier in The Apocalypse 1. The premier managed to
escape, luckily enough, he's safe and now he is commanding you to kill
the traitor that made the attempt on his life and lied about Cherdenko
being a traitor himself. Finish him off!!
