Game: Red Alert 3
Game Type: Mission
Max Players: 3
Map Description: This is a mission map, you will play as the Empire of the Rising Sun against the Allies. It is a Co-op mission map, which is heavily reliant on teamwork. Without teamwork, you won't make it to the end. Be smart and lead the Empire to victory! 

Story: The Empire is losing territory, the allies are coming really close to winning this war! This may never happen! Take your commando, for a stealth attack in enemy territory. Plan an attack on the most heavily defended Allied prison, rescue the prisoners and destroy the enemy. 
Make one mistake...... And you will be dead! 

This map has real objectives and there are a lot of cinematics in it. It has 3 different difficulties: Easy, Normal and Hard. Easy is really easy, even beginners can get to the end! With Normal setting, you will need to use teamwork, it is not too hard, but not too easy either. If you can beat the map set on the Hard level, all I can say is that you are expert. So there is a game setting to suit all levels of players.
