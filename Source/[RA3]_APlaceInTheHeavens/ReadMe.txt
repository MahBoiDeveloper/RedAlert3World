This is an expansion of my Ninja map Assassin’s Shadows. 
A Place In The Heavens features a new and extended array of units to use including the Tankbusters, Engineers and the IFV Gunner. The aim of the map will be the same however, it contains extra bonus features, including Control Points and automated defences. 

The game begins with a vote to see the intro. If more than 2 people press "Execute" then the intro will start. If you wait 30 seconds, then you are taken to the clan choice area. 

The Clan choice area is used to select the Clan for your units. This affects the outcome of your units as each Clan has unique benefits and fall backs. 
To pick a Clan, just select the unit that represents your clan choice. Traditional units are governed by the Shinobi and Technological units are governed by the Imperial Solider. Selecting a unit will give you a pop up box explaining to click the execute button to select the Clan in question. If you aren't sure which team you want, you can always select Yuriko who governs the random Clan option. 
Each Clan also have their highlights to help with your selection. Also note that both Clans use the dog unit. 

Here are the highlights: 

"Traditional" Clan : 
Shinobi 
Tsunami Tank 
Chrono Swap 

"Tech" Clan 
Allied Spy 
IFV Gunner 
Point-Defences-Drones 

The main goal of the battle is to own all of the Outposts on the map. Each allied outpost is located either North, South, East or West and the Japanese Radars are found in the center of the map. Only a single player can own all of them to win. Should something be preventing you from claiming your Outposts then infiltrate your enemy's "Nano Tech structure" to kill them. You can ether infiltrate it twice or capture it with an engineer to kill them with one shot. 

Again, I recommend you play this in a FFA/No teams state and with other human commanders. 

You can also now call for "Higher tech" honours which are bestowed upon you if you hold and control 2 radar tech structures for 2.5 minutes, these include some of the strongest and tactically diverse units your production factories are capable of.
