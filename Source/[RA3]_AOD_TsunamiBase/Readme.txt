Art of defense - Tsunami Base

This Art of Defense - Tsunami Base is a 4 player map (3 players +1 AI).
Unlike the normal Art of Defense you won't be attacked constantly. The enemy attacks you with burst attacks
These attacks consist out of a large ammount of units mainly of the same type. (Tanks or planes etc)
Between each wave there is a 2 min break of attacks. This time is given to give you the possibilty to rebuild you base or Tech up.

This map is not designed to be hard. More a fun map so you can bash 1 type of unit. 

The attacks will last for 20 min, after 20 min a short movie will be shown of a tsunami of tanks that get nuked away by 5 Vacuum imploders

 Fake copys of this map. (n00b list)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	These maps below have the same lay-out/attack scripts as the real version and therfore i mark them as n00b.

	- None yet.

	Just for the record: I don't mind if you use the same attack script as the one i made. 
	If you make your own lay-out then everything is fine. So don't copy mine!

 Copyright (lol)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	There is no such things as copyright on maps. First of all it cost money to place coprights on products and
	and secondly, This toolset(worldbuilder) was originally designed and primarily intended for
	internal use by the designers at Electronic Arts, and as such, it is not commercial software primarily designed 
	for mass-market use.
	
	However...

	You would do me a great plessure if you tested your edited maps and adjust the name properly. 
	Thanks and happy editing/scripting!
