Name: Jungle Ambush
Players: 2 (Skirmish/Multi)

=========================================
Notes:
=========================================

In this map, each player starts with 5 mirage tanks. The objective is to destroy the enemy's mirages by using stealth and ambush tactics.
The battlefield is littered with trees for the mirage tanks to camouflage. This map is intended for multiplayer, but it will work on skirmish.
On skirmish, however, the enemys move along a waypoint and it is very easy to win.
Have fun!
