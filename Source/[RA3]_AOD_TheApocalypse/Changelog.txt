__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Version 1.1 

Let me make it clear!!! There are now 3 difficulties on the map. Easy, Medium and Hard. You chose easy by putting the opponent AI that is going to be Premier Cherdenko on easy. You chose medium by putting him as medium and you chose hard by putting him as hard or brutal. (Doesn't really matter which one you chose. Hard and brutal is the same one and before this version 1.1 there weren't difficulty levels so I can inform you that medium is just like the old difficulty level while easy is easier and hard is... um... terrible brutally hard for those who wants a real challenge instead of only fun moving units around at the battlefield xD) 

- Adds round shape to a small part of the cliffs near the water so it's now possible to get out to the water without having to go around and down to the middle for doing it. 
- Bullfrogs are now unlocked in soviet naval yard. You will no longer need to build them from WF and get them out to the water. 
- Adds different difficulty levels to the map. Select it by chosing the difficulty of the AI. Easy is easy, medium is medium and hard/brutal is hard. The originally level is set to medium so hard is harder than ever! xD 
- Changes the ammount of start money. In easy you get 20000 like before, in medium you get 15000 and in brutal you get 12000. 
- Removed the enemy radar boats. 
- Removed the outposts on each side above the side ramps and added 4 more observations tower. 2 per high side-level. 
- Totally changed the protocol support powers system. Some are locked, some are unlocked in a different way now. 
- Adds flying MiG's passing over Premier's launch shuttle animation. 
- The Shogun Exectioner is now teleported to right outside of the base when it gets active at the end. Except from in hard/brutal mode, instead the 4 observation towers in your bases area gets destroyed and the shogun exectioner shows up there. 
- Changes some of the attacks in the orginially difficulty. 
- Natasha and Tanya is now locked and prevented from being trained. (Yuriko is locked from before) 
- Shogun Battleships, Dreadnoughts and Aircraft Carriers are now unlocked. (Tho you are unable to shoot at the enemy's base) 
- Flak cannons, Multigunner Turrets and Defender Turrets have now been locked in hard/brutal mode. 
- Tesla Trooper's EMP Secondary Ability is now disabled. 
- The hydrofoil's secondary ability gets disabled after Shogun Exectioner arrives at the end.
